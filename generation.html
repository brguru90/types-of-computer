		<h2>Types of computer based on generation:-</h2>
			<h4>First Generation(1940-56):Vaccum Tubes:</h4>
			<p>
			The first generation computer were developed in the year 1945 by the U.S>Army research unit.The computer was called as ENIAC(Electronic Numeric Integrator  And calculator) used to calculate the trajectories of the missiles.ENIAC took about  200 milisecond to add 2 digit and 280 microsecond to multiply.John von Neumann, a professor used the concept of stored program and designed a machine called as EDSAC.(Electronic Delay Storage Automatic computer).The first commercial production of stored Electroonic computer was UNIVAC(Universal Automic Computer).<br />
			eg.:ENIAC,UNIVAC-I<br />

			<b>Fetures</b><br />
			<ol>
				<li>The vaccum tubes took long time to get heated up and the processing speed of such machines was slow.</li>
				<li>These machines were very large in size and occupied more space.</li>
				<li>The component in these nachine generated lot of heat and thus needed more maintenece for longer life.</li>
				<li>System cost and woring cost is very high.</li>
				<li>First generation computer were built on the concept of stored program.</li>
				<li>Programs and data were fed through punched paper tape.</li>
			</ol>
			</p>
			<br /><br />
			<h4>Second Generation(1956-63):transister</h4>
			<p>A big revolution in electronic took place with the invention of transistord in 1956 by braden.The transistor replaced the bulky vaccum tubes.they occupied less space.Early 'third generation programming language(High level language)' were used on these machines.For eg.:FORTRAN,ALGOL and ANNABEL.
			EX.:IBM-1401,IBM-1620.

			<b>Fetures</b><br />
			<ol>
				<li>computers of this generation wee comparartively smaller in size than the first generation computer</li>
				<li>use of transistor in place of vaccum tubes made these machine more reliable and required less maintenence</li>
				<li>these had greater speed than the first generation and could process faster</li>
				<li>these machines had larger storage capacity and greater computing power</li>
				<li>magnetic tapes and disks appeared which were used to store program or data</li>
			</ol>
			</p>
			<br /><br />
			<h4>Third Generation(1964-Early 1970s):Integrated Circutes</h4>
			<p>
			hird generation computer sarted emerging around 1965.'sillicon chips' replaced tansistor due to the innovation in semiconductor technology.this helped to pack several transistor on a single silicon chip.the chips became populer as ICs(Integerated Circutes).the electronic component used in these computers are transistor,diodes,register,capacitor etc.<br />
			ex.:IBM 360series,CDC 7600.
			<br />
			<img src="img/third.jpg" /><br />
			<b>Fetures</b><br />
			<ol>
				<li>Integrated chips used on these machines considerabely redu</li>
				<li>these machines eased the usage of input and output devices</li>
				<li>these had the larger storage capacity and the greater speed compared to previous generation</li>
				<li>computer were smaller in size,hig in speed,used time sharing and multiprogramming concept etc.</li>
				<li>application such as order processing,reservation system,real time inventory contol etc.were developed in this generation.</li>
			</ol>
			</p>
			<br /><br />
			<h4>Fourth Generation(Early 1970s-Till date):Microprocessor</h4>
			<p>
			the fourt generation of computer emerged because f the advancement in technology inventing the large nd very large scale integrated circuted.these were having bundles of above one lakh transistors on single chips.at this scale entire processor is made to fit on the single chip and for a single system even the entire computer.pesronal computer were developed during this generation.
			development in software include very high level languages such as FP and prolog,pascal,C,C++,Java,c#,VB etc<br />
			ex.:CRAY 1,Apple Macintosh<br />

			</p>
			
			<br /><br />
			<h4>Fifth Generation(Present and byond):Artficial Intelegence</h4>
			<p>
			The present generation of computer is called as fifth generation. i.e. the generation in which we are living.work is going on at fast pace to increase both the speed and memory of the computer.the computers of fifth generation use inteligent programming and knowledge based probleom solving techniques with multi core and multi threaded fetures.the development of this generation computer system is characterised mainly by the accesptance of parallel processing.untill this time parallelism was limeted to pipelining and ve ctor processing,or at most to afew processor sharing jobs.fifth generation of cmputer make use of language that are non-procedural and constraints based languages.The languages are more independent from programmer.Eg.:OPS5,LISP,ADA,PROLOG,SmallTalk,C++,Java,VB etc. for programmming.<br />
			Ex:CRAY-X-MP-14,PARAM 8000 and 9000 series etc.
